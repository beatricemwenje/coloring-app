# PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:
1.Stable internet 
2.How to use HTML,CSS and Javascript
3.Should have a text editor of your choice, Though I recommend visual code.


# Project Folder Structure:
Let’s build the project folder structure before we begin writing the code. We create a project folder called ‘Paint App’. Inside this folder, we have three files. These files are index.html, style.css, and script.js.

# STEPS.
1.Create a folder which contains three files index.html,style.css and script.js
2.Create your index.html file using the touch command in the terminal.
3.Open your style.css to design your project.
4.Javascript:

a.Create variable initializations, and references to HTML elements. Just make sure to set the height and width variables to proper values based on SVG “viewbox” values.
b.Then create ‘isTouchDevice()’, which gives us the device type so that we could use it for responsible behavior. This also helps us to decide on the event to use based on device type.
c.Handle inputs for setting the color and size of the brush
d.When the user clicks/touches the image we get the x and y position



# CONCLUSION
We've been able to build our coloring app using the html,css and javascript.
